### Running the Builder

Ensure you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed and working.

Use the following commands to start the builder.

```js
// If needed, install version with `nvm install ...`
nvm use

cd builder && pnpm install

// I recommend running each of these in a split terminal window
pnpm style & pnpm start
```

Build something cool and send it to me!
